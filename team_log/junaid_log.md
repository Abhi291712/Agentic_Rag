### Week of Feb 24, 2025
**Kickoff & Planning**
- Attended project introduction and component assignment meeting.
- Discussed main components: document intake, vector database indexing, XML parsing/chunking, LLM RAG agent, and UI.
- Assigned as co-owner for document intake and vector database indexing.
- Began reviewing PubMed nxml file format and requirements for chunking and metadata extraction.

### Week of Mar 3, 2025
**Initial Exploration & Access Setup**
- Participated in XML format walkthrough and team planning.
- Explored structure of nxml files and identified key tags for parsing.
- Coordinated with team to ensure access to necessary resources (JS2, CyVerse, GitHub).
- Outlined initial approach for parsing and chunking nxml files.

### Week of Mar 10, 2025
**Vector Indexing Strategy**
- Reviewed and discussed strategies for vector indexing and integration with the rest of the system.
- Researched suitable encoder models for generating embeddings from chunked data.
- Began drafting code for parsing and chunking nxml files.

### Week of Mar 17, 2025
**Parsing & Chunking Implementation**
- Developed and tested code to parse nxml files and segment content into meaningful chunks.
- Ensured that chunking preserved semantic integrity and handled various XML structures.
- Coordinated with team on progress and integration points.

### Week of Mar 24, 2025
**Embedding Generation & Vector DB Integration**
- Finalized chunking pipeline and began generating embeddings using selected encoder model (e.g., all-MiniLM).
- Investigated and tested integration with Weaviate vector database.
- Collaborated with team to ensure compatibility between embedding format and vector DB requirements.
- Participated in review of integration efforts between UI and LLM code.

### Week of Mar 31, 2025
**Cloud Infrastructure & Pipeline Testing**
- Set up a virtual machine instance on Jetstream2 (JS2) for large-scale embedding generation.
- Installed necessary dependencies and configured environment for processing nxml files.
- Ran end-to-end pipeline: parsing, chunking, embedding generation, and storage in Weaviate vector DB.
- Troubleshot issues related to data transfer and storage.

### Week of Apr 7, 2025
**System Integration & Optimization**
- Worked on integrating the embedding pipeline with the RAG agent for semantic retrieval.
- Optimized chunking and embedding code for performance and reliability on JS2.
- Coordinated with team to identify and address integration bottlenecks.

### Week of Apr 21, 2025
**Finalization & Reporting**
- Participated in system review and progress reporting.
- Verified completeness of embedding storage in vector DB.
- Documented pipeline, challenges, and solutions for project report.
- Provided screenshots and examples for project documentation.

### Week of Apr 28, 2025
**Wrap-up & Handover**
- Attended final project meetings and contributed to wrap-up discussions.
- Ensured all code and documentation were up to date in the project repository.
- Supported team in preparing for final presentation and iShowcase.

## Summary of Technical Contributions

- Analyzed and parsed nxml files, developed robust chunking logic.
- Generated high-quality embeddings using state-of-the-art models.
- Set up and managed vector database (Weaviate) for efficient retrieval.

**Reflections:**
This project enhanced my skills in large-scale data processing, cloud deployment, and modern retrieval systems. I gained hands-on experience with XML parsing, embedding generation, and vector database management, and learned to collaborate effectively in a distributed team environment.
